<p>Hallo Welt :)</p>
<p>Ich bin die Lulu und ich mag WoW. Leider kenne ich mich mit der Lore nicht so gut aus. Zeit, das zu ändern und meine Lesereise zu beginnen.</p>
<p>Die bestmögliche Reihenfolge der Bücher, Comics, Mangas und Videos zu finden, ist gar nicht so einfach. Ich halte mich an die Empfehlungen von Reddit-User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/warcraftlore/comments/122oiwz/warcraft_in_chronological_order_games_books/">Drakemaster1991</a>.</p>
<p>Hier ist die Leseliste auf Deutsch.</p>

Kalimdor are now shared by two nations: the orcs of Durotar, led by their noble Warchief, Thrall; and the humans of Theramore, led by one of the most powerful mages alive -- Lady Jaina Proudmoore. But the tentative peace between orcs and humans is suddenly crumbling. Random attacks against Durotar's holdings suggest that the humans have renewed their aggression toward the orcs. Now Jaina and Thrall must avert disaster before old hatreds are rekindled -- and Kalimdor is plunged into another devastating war. Jaina's search to uncover the truth behind the attacks leads her to a shocking revelation. Her encounter with a legendary, long-lost wizard will challenge everything that she believes and illuminate the secret history of the world of Warcraft."]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"detail-label"},"children":["Warcraft

To do that go to Blasted Lands and phase into present time. You can start the quests at Shattered Beachhead and Shattered Landing for Alliance and Horde respectively. Note that currently the final quest completion is bugged for horde. The NPC to return it to is not there in Orgrimar. I read that after some quest chain in later expansion it might phase back to Ordgrimar, so I kept the quest into the log. To start the quests that actually lead to Draenor, talk to Khadgar in front of the dark portal. You might want to play through with both horde and alliance until your garrison is level 2 in order to start doing the Garrison Campaign as soon as possible. Then you can revert to finish the expansion with 1 faction and then the other. How those campaign work you can find out here Garrison_Campaign. Long story short you will need about 3 months to finish it up. When your garrison is upgraded to level 3 you will also get a later expansion patch garrison campaign. I personally choose to wait until I finish the 1st 3 parts before I start this 1 and also I don't go through the Hellfire Citadel raid as the final garrison campaign will lead into it. However if you don't want to wait feel free to watch videos and/or read the quests. Horde/Alliance Video. I've posted the quests already earlier in this description. Now after the original garrison quest line you would want to watch the video and/or read the quests for the deleted legendary ring questline, Horde/Alliance Video until 50 min and questline at Legendary quest line until \"The final Assault\", then continue with the garrison level 3 campaign and then finish the legendary ring off, otherwise the connection between the 1st and second garrison campaigns will not make sense (Go figure why blizzard keeps deleting lore relevant content :/)"]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"display":"grid","grid-template-columns":"repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr))","gap":"0.75rem"},"className":"lore-detail"},"children":[{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"grid-column":"span 2"}},"children":[]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"display":"grid","grid-template-columns":"repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr))","gap":"0.75rem"},"className":"lore-detail"},"children":[{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"grid-column":"span 2"}},"children":[]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"display":"grid","grid-template-columns":"repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr))","gap":"0.75rem"},"className":"lore-detail"},"children":[{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"grid-column":"span 2"}},"children":[{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"detail-label"},"children":["Zusatzinfos"]},"Teil 1 bis 4 hören/lesen"]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"display":"grid","grid-template-columns":"repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr))","gap":"0.75rem"},"className":"lore-detail"},"children":[{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"grid-column":"span 2"}},"children":[]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"display":"grid","grid-template-columns":"repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr))","gap":"0.75rem"},"className":"lore-detail"},"children":[{"name":"div","attribs":{},"children":[]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"style":{"grid-column":"span 2"}},"children":[{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"detail-label"},"children":["Zusatzinfos"]},"There are also PDFs in the link if you prefer to read.
